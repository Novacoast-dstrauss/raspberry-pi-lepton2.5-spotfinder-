        gpiozero
        ========
        
        A simple interface to everyday GPIO components used with Raspberry Pi.
        
        Created by `Ben Nuttall`_ of the `Raspberry Pi Foundation`_, `Dave Jones`_, and
        other contributors.
        
        Latest release

        The latest release is 1.0 released on 16th November 2015.
        
        About
        =====
        
        With very little code, you can quickly get going connecting your physical
        components together::
        
            from gpiozero import LED, Button
        
            led = LED(2)
            button = Button(3)
        
            button.when_pressed = led.on
            button.when_released = led.off
        
        The library includes interfaces to many simple everyday components, as well as
        some more complex things like sensors, analogue-to-digital converters, full
        colour LEDs, robotics kits and more.
        
        Install
